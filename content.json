BackgroundHow to backup your Apex code/metadata from your Salesforce organization in your Local Side? As you know, salesforce currently, don’t have code version management, and developers should backup and manage code in their local side for their future comparison. Today, I will share some experience about how we backup our Apex code/metadata in our local side. The library we are used is JSFORCE (http://jsforce.github.io/document/#bulk-api) and you need to finish related setup in your side And I used one JavaScript library named ‘js-beautify’ (http://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify) which can reformat the metadata in our local file. How to use Jsforce to login SFDC Production env?I run following code in CLOUD9 and I will connect to Production ENV. 123456789101112var jsforce = require(&apos;jsforce&apos;); var conn = new jsforce.Connection(&#123; loginUrl: &apos;https://login.salesforce.com&apos;,//&apos;https://login.salesforce.com&apos;, version: &apos;36.0&apos; &#125;); conn.login(&apos;YOURACCOUNT&apos;, &apos;YOURASSWORD&apos;, function(err, res) &#123; if (err) &#123; return console.error(err); &#125; console.log(&apos;OK&apos;); &#125;); In normal case, we will have following error: tonyrenhk:~/workspace $ node PD1209.js [Error: LOGIN_MUST_USE_SECURITY_TOKEN: Invalid username, password, security token; or user locked out. Are you at a new location? When accessing Salesforce--either via a desktop client or the API--from outside of your company’s trusted networks, you must add a security token to your password to log in. To get your new security token, log in to Salesforce. From your personal settings, enter Reset My Security Token in the Quick Find box, then select Reset My Security Token.] tonyrenhk:~/workspace $ node PD1209.js OK Are you including your Security Token with your password? Unless your org is configured to allow login without a security token, you will need to include it in the password field of your connection request. So your password entry will be ‘passwordXXXXXX’, where ‘XXXXXX’ is your security token.If you don’t know your security token, follow the instructions in the error message to reset it.

SolutionThe following code is added class to call email template to send email tocertain email address.The code like this： Generally we send emails from Salesforce using following ways : Apex Code Email Alerts Outbound messaging etc. In all of these ways we normally set ‘To’/‘Cc’/‘Bcc’ but have you thought how to control ‘From address of email’? what to do if we need to send email displaying any other email address in ‘from’ part instead of sender’s email address. Here is one Salesforce feature to get rid of this problem that is “Organization-Wide Email Addresses”. In above screen shot you just need to Navigate Setup -&gt; Email Administration -&gt; Organization-Wide Email Addresses Click on Add button. Enter email Id and display name of sender. In order to complete this process you need to get verified email id you are putting here ( in this example it is &#39;testuser@gmail.com‘). Now it is ready for use.

(Doc ID 853231.1)","text":"Understanding How to Optimize Essbase Caches. (Doc ID 853231.1) APPLIES TO:Hyperion Essbase - Version 9.0.0.0.00 and laterInformation in this document applies to any platform.(Checked for Relevance 28-May-2014) GOALUnderstanding Essbase Caches Settings. SOLUTIONUnderstanding Cache Settings: The sizes of the index cache and the data file cache (when direct I/O is used) are the most critical Essbase cache settings. In general, the larger these caches, the less swapping activity occurs; however, it does not always help performance to set cache sizes larger and larger. Read this entire section to understand cache size considerations. Index Cache: Whenever the index cache size equals or exceeds the index size (including all index files on all volumes), performance does not improve. However, to account for future growth of the index, you can set the index cache size larger than the current index size. Because the index cache is filled with index pages, for optimum use of storage, set the size of the index cache to be a multiple of the size of the index page (8 KB). Data File Cache (Direct I/O only): If possible, set the data file cache to equal the size of the stored data, which is the combined size of all ess*.pag files. Otherwise, the data file cache should be as large as possible. If you want to account for future growth of stored data, you can set the data file cache size larger than the current size of stored data.NOTE: Direct I/O is deprecated in release 11.1.2.4 Data Cache: The data cache should be about 0.125 times the data file cache. However, certain calculations require a larger data cache size. If many concurrent users are accessing different data blocks, this cache should be larger. The default setting is 3072K (in version 6.0 and higher). To find out how many blocks can fit into this cache, take your setting and divide it by your block size: Data Cache in K ——————— = Number of blocks that can be allocated Block Size in K Compare this number with your CALCLOCKBLOCKDEFAULT setting. If this setting is 100 and your allocated block number is less than 100, you need to increase your data cache. The recommended size is 100 x 2 x block size (in K) which is enough to hold 100 blocks. Remember to stop and restart your database in order for the new settings to take effect. If your CALCLOCKBLOCKDEFAULT setting is 100 and your allocated block number is larger than 100, you need to change your CALCLOCKBLOCKDEFAULT setting to a higher number. Start by doubling it to 200. Set this in your essbase.cfg file. Remember, to stop and start the Essbase server agent (essbase.exe) process for those settings to take effect. Go back and look at your data cache setting. Make sure it is set high enough to hold 200 blocks (to calculate: 200 x 2 x block size in Kilobytes). Checking Cache Hit Ratio: Every cache has a “hit ratio.” The hit ratio indicates the percentage of time that a requested piece of information is available in the cache. You can check the hit ratio of the index cache, the data cache, and the data file cache to determine whether you need to increase the cache size. A higher hit ratio indicates that the data is in the cache more often. This improves performance because the requested data does not have to be retrieved from disk for the next process. A hit ratio of 1.0 indicates that every time data is requested, it is found in the cache. This is the maximum performance possible from a cache setting. The Hit Ratio on Index Cache setting indicates the Essbase Kernel success rate in locating index information in the index cache without having to retrieve another index page from disk.The Hit Ratio on Data File Cache setting indicates the Essbase Kernel success rate in locating data file pages in the data file cache without having to retrieve the data file from disk. The Hit Ratio on Data Cache setting indicates the Essbase success rate in locating data blocks in the data cache without having to retrieve the block from the data file cache.
